# BonaireTourist_Behaviour_and_Demand
Tourism brings economic fortune to Bonaire. At the same time, it is detrimental, especially to the natural ecosystem of the island. Studying tourist behavior is an important precaution to the impact of tourists on the island. By studying tourist behavior, the government could identify their demands. Then it would be helpful to the tourism strategic decision-making. However, the previous study by the survey to study tourist behavior is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. That is why this project is trying to learn the behaviour and demand of tourist in Bonaire island by utilizing the social media data, which in this case would be Flickr.

The Flickr metadata has been cleaned and the csv file can be accessed here: http://bit.ly/Bonaire_Data

Currently, there are two methods to be done:
1. Clustering the neighborhood of Bonaire island using DBSCAN clustering method based on keywords similarity. The keywords were weighted by TF-IDF.
2. Time Series Modelling
